You: explain html syntax and html syntax function
AI:  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create web pages. It consists of a series of elements that define the structure and content of a webpage. Here’s an overview of basic HTML syntax and its functions:

### Basic HTML Syntax
1. **Elements**: An element in HTML typically consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. Some elements are self-closing (e.g., `<br>`).
   ```html
   <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
   ```
2. **Attributes**: Attributes provide additional information about the element and are specified within the start tag.
   ```html
   <tagname attribute="value">Content</tagname>
   ```
3. **Comments**: Comments in HTML begin with `<!--` and end with `-->`. They are ignored by the browser but can be useful for documentation.
   ```html
   <!-- This is a comment -->
   ```

### Functions of HTML Syntax
1. **Structure**: HTML elements help define the structure of a webpage, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, links, and more.
2. **Content Semantics**: Elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` provide semantic meaning to content, enhancing accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
3. **Forms**: HTML forms allow users to input data that can be sent to a server for processing using elements like `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`.
4. **Links**: The `<a>` element is used to create hyperlinks, connecting pages together or to other resources on the web.
5. **Media Elements**: HTML includes elements for embedding media such as images (`<img>`), videos (`<video>`), and audio (`<audio>`).
6. **Tables**: The `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` elements are used to create tables, useful for organizing data in rows and columns.
7. **Semantic Markup**: HTML5 introduced several new semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, and `<figure>`, which help define the role of different parts of a webpage.

By using these elements and attributes correctly, developers can create well-structured, semantically meaningful web pages that are both functional and accessible.
You: different between semantic vs non-semantic tag
AI:  Semantic tags in HTML are elements whose names clearly describe their purpose, such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These tags provide meaning to the structure of a web page, making it easier for both browsers and developers to understand the content. Non-semantic tags, on the other hand, do not convey any information about the content they contain, such as `<div>` and `<span>`. They are essentially generic containers that provide no context or meaning beyond their grouping function.
You: HTML with css basic
AI:  Sure! Let's dive into some basic concepts of HTML combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

### HTML Structure
Here is a simple example of an HTML document:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS Basics
CSS is used to style HTML elements. It can be included in three ways: inline styles, internal stylesheets (in the `<head>` of an HTML document), and external stylesheets (linked via `<link>`). Here’s how you might include a simple CSS rule using all three methods.

#### Inline Styles
```html
<h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Hello, World!</h1>
```

#### Internal Stylesheet
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 24px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### External Stylesheet
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
